# Spiritual Security Shield™

Welcome. I am Wendy Walton — creator of **Spiritual Security Shield™**, dedicated to building
low-EMF devices and tools designed to block and shield your mind, body, and soul from the harmful,
chaotic energy constantly emitted by the digital world.

My work blends cybersecurity logic with spiritual science to create calm, intentional, frequency-safe
technology. Technology should protect you, not drain you — and every device I design reflects that belief.

## What I Create
Low-EMF e-readers  
Spiritual operating systems  
Digital grimoires  
Energetic protection tools  
Ritual, herb, element, and frequency databases  
Calm-first user experiences  

## My Mission
To engineer safe, grounding, spiritually aligned technology for awakening souls.  
To protect clarity, intuition, and inner truth in a world full of digital static.  
To build devices that support spiritual practice rather than disrupt it.  

## Current Work
- The Shielded Spellbook™ (low EMF spiritual e-reader)
- A full database of rituals, herbs, crystals, and energy practices
- EMF-conscious wearable designs
- Grounding audio and meditation tools

## About Me
- B.S. Computer Science – Cybersecurity (April 2026)
- 10+ years in customer leadership and experience navigation
- Spiritual practitioner focused on herbalism, candle work, intuition, and energetic protection
